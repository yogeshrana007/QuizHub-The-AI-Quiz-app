                    1. The quizzes consists of questions carefully designed to
                    help you self-assess your comprehension of the information
                    presented on the topics covered in the module. No data will
                    be collected on the website regarding your responses or how
                    many times you take the quiz.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. Each question in the quiz is of multiple-choice or "true
                    or false" format. Read each question carefully, and click on
                    the button next to your response that is based on the
                    information covered on the topic in the module. Each correct
                    or incorrect response will result in appropriate feedback
                    immediately at the bottom of the screen.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. After responding to a question, click on the "Next

                    4.If you select an incorrect response for a question, you
                    can try again until you get the correct response. If you

                    responses will be randomized.

                    all questions. If you respond incorrectly to a question or
                    retake a question again and get the correct response, your
                    quiz score will reflect it appropriately. However, your quiz
                    will not be graded, if you skip a question or exit before
                    responding to all the questions.
